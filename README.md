This repository contains some numerical simulations replicated from [1]: "Scaling Laws of Associative Memory Retrieval" by Romani, Tsodyks (2013) and [2]: "Fundamental Law of Memory Recall" by Naim, Katkov, Romani and Tsodyks (2019). 

In particular:
- `01_Hopfield_model.ipynb` contains the simulation for the Hopfield network model of free recall presented in sec. 2.1 of [1].
- `02_Reco_model.ipynb` simulates the simplified model of free recall presented and studied analytically in [2].
